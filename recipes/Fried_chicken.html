    <h4>Tasty Fried chicken</h4>

    <p>Fried chicken has it's roots in the south eastern portion of the United States of America.
      Its actually really simple to make for how popular it is. It consist of chicken(any part really) and 
      some sort of batter(flaky or fluffy). People from all backgrounds love it.</p>
      <!-- Fixed Typo. Added emphasis.-->
    <p>I remember the first time I inhaled a piece of fried chicken I had actually gone down to 
      Bojangles(<em>South Eastern Fried Chicken Fast Food resturaunt</em>.). I remember the crunch. The slight taste
      of the seasonings. Then afterwards washing it down with a Half Tea/Half lemonade beverage. It was 
      glorious. So let's talk about what it takes to make this.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <!--ommited "skillet" bullet point-->
      </ul>
      <p>Now that you have the ingredients it is time to get cooking!!</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First we need to make our batter.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl combine 
          <ul>
            <li>3oz of Milk</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp of cornstarch</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt/Pepper</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Whisk unitl Homogunous. We are looking for a custard like consistency.</li>
        <li>Wash the chicken</li>
        <li>Next we wanna get either a saucepan or skillet.</li>
        <li>Put the oil in  the skillet and bring it to a paint where you barely just see bubbles coming up
          <p>(If you have a thermometer the oil should read 275 degrees farenheit)</p>
        </li>
        <li>When our oil is ready its time to dip our chicken into the batter</li>
        <li>Dip one piece and wait until it finishes dripping then dip it again.</li>
        <li>Start a process of dipping and putting them in the hot oil.</li>
        <li>You will notice that they sink at first but after some time they float to the top. This means
          they are finished
        </li>
        <!-- Fixed typo-->
        <li>Layers some paper towels on a plate and lay the chicken on it to dry.</li>
      </ol>
